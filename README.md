OpenTADA, for Open-Source Text Adventure Diamond Age, is a multi-agent AI rework of the text adventure genre of which Colossal Cave was the debut and Zork remains the archetype. Yes, "Diamond Age" comes from the Stephenson novel and I thank my brother Buck for introducing me to it!



# Prototype
This is the example prompt that was used to prototype this process on Google Gemini to help make sure an old friend doesn't have a schism with his visual novelist daughter over AI (though actually I think they're OK). Try pasting it into Google Gemini or the LLM of your choice and tweaking the "the player is" statement to match yourself!

Serafina’s Diamond Age

Please read the following description of an OpenTADA text adventure game. Understanding the setting and characters, please render an image in watercolor style of scene 1. Take any further inputs as player actions in a text adventure game akin to Zork. When the action moves to a different scene, or what has just happened differs significantly from what was last rendered as an image, render a new image. Otherwise, respond by describing the actions, dialogue, and scenes resulting from the player actions specified. Do not deviate from this process for the remainder of this conversation.

Player Character: JJ Abromawitz (see below)

Setting: Somewhere in the USA, 2025.

Characters:
Serafina Abromawitz: An acclaimed novelist. Her work is the intersection of John Steinbeck and Cormac McCarthy. She is enamored of the humanity, the realness, of literature. Large language models upset her because, as she sees it, they steal from real human authors.

Joseph Abromawitz: A world-class computer programmer. He has collaborated with his daughter, the aforementioned Serafina, before. However, they are at odds because his work on artificial intelligence conflicts with Serafina’s literary ideals. He wants to work with her again, or at least extract the wedge that AI and the way that society views it has driven between them.

JJ Abromawitz: (For Joseph Junior) Son of Joseph, younger brother of Serafina.

Bill Gambler: A friend and former colleague of Joseph. Bill is a computer programmer and hacker who has spent time in prison and in mental hospitals. He has a moderate view of Large Language Models as a tool to facilitate human communication and connection in an unprecedented way. When Joseph calls him, his words may help to bring the two together — either by wisely counseling them to resolve their differences, or by being so strange that their differences seem trivial in comparison.

Outcomes:
- Eventually, Joseph and Serafina reach a better understanding or at least detente.

Scenes:
- (Start) Serafina is upset at how Joseph’s AI job has put them at odds.


The player is a huge Star Wars fan and will be sharing the results with his child. The text should be simple and appropriate for a fourth-grade reading level. Images should be photorealistic style.


Start by describing scene 1 and rendering an image of it.
